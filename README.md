#ChanCOPter

## Usage
Clone or download the repository and inside the directory you cloned/downloaded into, run:
  
`./installChanCOPter`

which will run `sbt pack` and copy an example `market.json` file in the current directory.

After this you can run:
 
`./ChanCOPter <budget_in_cents> ` 

to run the application. 

Avalilable products should be in a file named `market.json`, but as mentioned above, `installChanCOPter` will copy a valid example, if you do not want to create your own.
